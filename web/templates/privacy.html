            <h2>Data Storage</h2>
            <p>The only data we store is:</p>

                <li><strong>Stripe's role:</strong> Stripe acts as our payment processor and is subject to their own privacy policy</li>
                <li><strong>Data retention:</strong> Stripe retains payment and customer data according to their data retention policies and legal requirements</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Analytics and Usage Tracking</h2>
            <p>We use Google Analytics to understand how our service is used and to improve the user experience. Google Analytics collects:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Performance metrics:</strong> Page load times and user interactions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is processed by Google and is subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. No personally identifiable information from your account is shared with Google Analytics.</p>
            <p><strong>Opting out:</strong> You can opt out of Google Analytics tracking by installing the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a> or by using browser settings to block tracking scripts.</p>
            
            <h2>Data Usage</h2>
            <p>We use your information solely to provide the RSS feed reading service and process subscription payments. Beyond our payment processor (Stripe) and analytics provider (Google Analytics), we do not share, sell, or distribute your personal information to other third parties.</p>
            
            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Your data is retained only as long as you have an active account. You may request deletion of your account and all associated data at any time.</p>
            <p><strong>Subscription data:</strong> If you have a paid subscription, some payment-related data may be retained by Stripe for legal and regulatory compliance even after account deletion. This includes transaction records required for tax purposes and fraud prevention.</p>
            
            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>You have the right to:</p>
