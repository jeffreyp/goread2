User loads first 50 articles (offset=0)\n2. User marks some as read\n3. Server's unread query now returns different results for offset positions\n4. Clicking 'Load More' with offset=50 can skip articles or show duplicates\n\n## Current Workaround\n\nClient-side duplicate detection using a Set of loaded article IDs. This prevents duplicates but doesn't solve the skipped articles problem.\n\n## Ideal Solution\n\nImplement cursor-based pagination using timestamps:\n\n- Instead of offset, use before parameter with article timestamp/ID\n- Example: /api/feeds/all/articles?limit=50\u0026before=2025-10-13T18:30:00\u0026unread_only=true\n- Server returns articles published before the cursor, maintaining consistent ordering\n- Works correctly even when articles are marked as read between requests\n\n## Implementation\n\nBackend changes needed:\n- Modify GetUserArticlesPaginated in feed service to accept cursor parameter\n- Change SQL query from OFFSET to WHERE published_at \u003c ? with ORDER BY published_at DESC\n- Return cursor value for next page in response\n\nFrontend changes:\n- Track cursor (timestamp of last article) instead of offset\n- Pass cursor to subsequent requests\n\n## Benefits\n\n- No duplicate articles\n- No skipped articles  \n- Consistent pagination regardless of read/unread state changes\n- Better performance (cursor queries faster than large offsets)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-13T18:41:47.375395-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-13T18:42:30.210238-07:00"}

{"id":"goread2-60","title":"Add request-scoped caching to eliminate duplicate GetUserFeeds calls","description":"**Location:** Multiple handlers calling GetUserFeeds multiple times per request\n\n**Problem:**\nGetUserFeeds is called multiple times within a single request chain, causing duplicate Firestore reads. This is particularly wasteful since user's feed list rarely changes.\n\n**Example Request Flow:**\n```\nGET /api/feeds → GetFeeds handler\n  ├─ GetUserFeeds() [READ 1]\n  └─ GetUnreadCounts()\n      └─ GetUserFeeds() [READ 2 - DUPLICATE!]\n```\n\n**Impact:**\n- #4 source of Firestore read costs\n- Estimated 500K+ duplicate reads/year\n- Called from multiple endpoints:\n  * internal/handlers/feed_handler.go:39 (GetFeeds)\n  * internal/handlers/feed_handler.go:152 (GetArticles)\n  * internal/handlers/feed_handler.go:287 (DebugFeed)\n  * internal/handlers/feed_handler.go:547 (GetAccountStats)\n  * internal/services/feed_service.go:343 (GetUserUnreadCounts)\n\n**Solution: Request-Scoped Cache**\n\nCreate middleware that adds a request-scoped cache to gin.Context:\n\n```go\n// internal/middleware/request_cache.go\ntype RequestCache struct {\n    userFeeds map[int][]database.Feed\n    mu        sync.RWMutex\n}\n\nfunc RequestCacheMiddleware() gin.HandlerFunc {\n    return func(c *gin.Context) {\n        cache := \u0026RequestCache{\n            userFeeds: make(map[int][]database.Feed),\n        }\n        c.Set(\"request_cache\", cache)\n        c.Next()\n    }\n}\n\n// Helper function to get cached user feeds\nfunc GetCachedUserFeeds(c *gin.Context, userID int, db database.Database) ([]database.Feed, error) {\n    cache, exists := c.Get(\"request_cache\")\n    if !exists {\n        // No cache, fetch directly\n        return db.GetUserFeeds(userID)\n    }\n    \n    rc := cache.(*RequestCache)\n    rc.mu.RLock()\n    if feeds, cached := rc.userFeeds[userID]; cached {\n        rc.mu.RUnlock()\n        return feeds, nil // Cache hit!\n    }\n    rc.mu.RUnlock()\n    \n    // Cache miss - fetch and store\n    feeds, err := db.GetUserFeeds(userID)\n    if err == nil {\n        rc.mu.Lock()\n        rc.userFeeds[userID] = feeds\n        rc.mu.Unlock()\n    }\n    return feeds, err\n}\n```\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n1. Create request cache middleware\n2. Add to API route group in main.go\n3. Update all handlers to use GetCachedUserFeeds()\n4. Test that cache is scoped per-request (no cross-contamination)\n\n**Expected Savings:**\n- 15-20% reduction in duplicate reads\n- Eliminates 2-3 reads per request\n- Faster response times (no duplicate DB calls)\n- Zero memory overhead (cache cleared after request)\n\n**Priority:** P2 - Lower priority than queries that fetch ALL data, but still valuable","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-17T16:13:03.133134-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-18T12:37:13.015559-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-18T12:37:13.015559-07:00"}
